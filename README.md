# Minecraft-Flux ![Minecraft Flux Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Szewek/Minecraft-Flux/master/src/main/resources/mcflux.png) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Szewek/Minecraft-Flux.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Szewek/Minecraft-Flux)
An open energy distribution system for Minecraft mods.

## Your first question: Why?
When CoFH Energy API (which was only a part of CoFH API) was released to public many developers started implementing it in their own mods.
But when Minecraft 1.9 and 1.10 came out only a few of them tried implementing code recommended for 1.8 to future versions.
This mod/library provides a simple way of implementing energy to items, tile entities and... even living entities.

Minecraft-Flux uses Forge Capabilities to implement energy handling (it's optional).

It requires Java 8 to run.

## TODO List
- [ ] Find a good Maven repo
- [ ] Provide RF Compatiblity (including wrappers for capabilities)
- [ ] Add Flavored Energy (like Vis or Mana)
- [ ] Compatibility for non-RF mods (like InductrialCraft 2)
